# Synapse
EXSII featured a truly interactive live event, enabled by Synapse, a cutting-edge mod that brings players from around the world together to engage with innovative new maps in real-time.
Participants compete against each other on a shared leaderboard and can communicate seamlessly using the in-game chat feature.
### https://exsii.totalbs.dev/

## Features
- Takeover the main menu with your own prefabs during the countdown to build hype.
- A countdown and custom banner from the main menu, along with notifications from anywhere in-game that your event is live.
- A 1-hour grace period to automatically download required mods for an event.
- Multiple divisions so all players can enjoy their preferred difficulty.
- A fully featured chatroom where players can interact with each other, complete with moderation tools like banning malicious users, as well as toggleable options like a profanity filter or opting-out of chat entirely.
- Replace the lobby with a custom prefab themed around your event, which also includes custom cinematics that can play as an intro or outro.
- Download and synchronously start maps for all players to experience maps at the same time.
- An event leaderboard where players can compete with each other, as well as the ability to run tournament formats which can eliminate players each round.
- All dockerized to be easily portable.
- Seamlessly runs, even with 1900+ players, as shown during EXSII.

## Setup for event hosts
#### Interested in running an event using Synapse? Contact me and I can help config and list your event using the official API.

By default, Synapse will check `https://synapse.totalbs.dev/api/v1/directory` for an active listing.
This can be changed by going to `UserData/Synapse.json` and editing the URL to point to your own API.

The backend for Synapse is made up of two projects, the listing and the server.
- The listing is a simple API that the client mod will ping everytime the game is started. It contains necessary information such where to connect to the server, when the event starts, and any required assets needed to join.
- The server is what the clients actually connect to. It runs the entire event.

The recommended way to run the server is using docker.
Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```yml
services:
  synapse-listing:
    image: ghcr.io/aeroluna/synapse-listing
    container_name: synapse-listing
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://synapse-listing:1000
      - ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED=true
    volumes:
      - ./synapse/listing/wwwroot:/app/wwwroot
      - ./synapse/listing/appsettings.Production.json:/app/appsettings.Production.json
    restart: unless-stopped

  synapse-server:
    image: ghcr.io/aeroluna/synapse-server
    container_name: synapse-server
    depends_on:
      - synapse-listing
    environment:
      - DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT=Production
    volumes:
      - ./synapse/server/appsettings.Production.json:/app/appsettings.Production.json
      - ./synapse/server/config:/config
    ports:
      - 1001:1001
    stdin_open: true 
    tty: true
```

The configuration is done using two `appsettings.ENVIRONMENT.json` for the listing and server. This will typically be `appsettings.Production.json`. Example configs can be found at `Synapse.Listing/appsettings.json.sample` and `Synapse.Server/appsettings.json.sample`

Although assets can be hosted from `wwwroot/` using the Listing project, it is recommended to use a CDN. Example assets can be found in the `SampleAssets` directory.

## Commands
Roles can grant the following permissions:
- 1 = Coordinator: Can control the flow of the event, i.e. start/stop maps manually, change motd, etc.
- 2 = Moderator: Can moderate other users, i.e. ban or kick users
- 4 = NoQualify: Users with this permission are unable to qualify
Example `roles.json`:
```json5
[
  {
    "name": "coordinator",
    "priority": 99, // Can only affect users with a lower priority than themselves
    "color": "red", // Username color in chat. See https://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/rich-text/#color. Will use role with highest priority
    "permission": 1 // Bitmask of permissions
  }
]
```
Example `admins.json`:
```json5
[
  {
    "roles": [
      "moderator",
      "mapper",
      "coordinator"
    ],
    "id": "76561198301904113_Steam",
    "username": "Aeroluna"
  }
]
```
All users that connect will be given an ID in the following format: `PLATFORMID_PLATFORM`, e.g. `76561172306506184_Steam` or `2026218196532328_OculusRift`.

Commands be sent through the server, or from a client with appropriate permissions by beginning a chat message with `/`, e.g. `/say hello!`

Commands which need an ID/username can use the start of a name instead. i.e. `kick aero` will find the user `Aeroluna`.
Commands that use options can be combined, i.e. `-e -f` is the same as `-ef`.

Nested lists represent subcommands, e.g. `scores backup reload`.
